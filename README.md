# Advent Of Code
My solutions for the [Advent of Code challenges](https://adventofcode.com)
> see my [notes](./doc) too

I tried to do every challenge in C but sometimes you'll see other languages solutions too.  
The input is always `input.txt`, the C solution often/always uses `tcc` with shebang (explained [here](./1dec/README.md#solution)).
